# Simple Recommendation Engine

## Description

This is a demo of a [content-based filtering](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/content-based/basics) recommendation engine built in ruby. The engine recommends board games based on the user's profile.
The algorithm uses four game features to calculate a similarity score of between 0 - 100 for each game. A similarity score is a measure of the closeness or likeness of a game to the user's preferences. The similarity score is then used to recommend games the user might love.

## TODO
- [ ] Update user's profile when they review new games
